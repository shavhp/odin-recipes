<h2>Description</h2>
<p><strong><em>Wondrously Fluffy Vegan Pancakes, incredibly easy to make with a handful of pantry staples! Made in 1 bowl.</em></strong></p>
<p>I love having a few staple recipes for when I'm craving baked sweet goods. If you have some basic baking ingredients around the house, make some pancakes! I donâ€™t know about you, but I love <em>veganizing</em> classic recipes. So I tend to try this with all the food I love! But no matter what, I always make sure it is tasty.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>75 g buckwheat flour</li>
    <li>125 ml rice drink</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 lime, juiced</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a medium bowl, add the rice drink, sugar, oil and lime juice. Whisk until well combined.</li>
    <li>Add the flour to the wet ingredients, then sprinkle the baking powder and salt on top of the flour. Mix until just combined with a wooden spoon.</li>
    <li>Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown until the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter.</li>
    <li>Serve with vegan butter, powdered sugar and/or maple syrup. The recipe can be easily doubled, tripled or quadrupled.</li>
