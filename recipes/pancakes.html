<h2>Description</h2>
<p><strong><em>Wondrously Fluffy Vegan Pancakes, incredibly easy to make with a handful of pantry staples! Made in 1 bowl.</em></strong></p>
<p>I love having a few staple recipes for when I'm craving baked sweet goods. If you have some basic baking ingredients around the house, make some pancakes! I donâ€™t know about you, but I love <em>veganizing</em> classic recipes. So I tend to try this with all the food I love! But no matter what, I always make sure it is tasty.</p>
