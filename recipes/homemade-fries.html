<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="intro"><strong><em>These homemade french fries are potatoes that are cut into sticks and deep fried until golden brown, then sprinkled with seasonings. Homemade fries are WAY better than anything you’d get at a restaurant, and are fun and easy to make.</em></strong></p>
<p class="intro second">You can never go wrong with potatoes as a side dish, whether it’s baked potato wedges, garlic mashed potatoes or these classic french fries. Pair your fries with a burger, or serve them with steak, and watch the rave reviews come in!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 big Russet potato</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1/4 tbsp Parsley <em>optional</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into matchsticks, either with a knife or with a french fry cutter. The potato pieces should all be similar in size.</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Soak the potatoes for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the potatoes. Place the potatoes on a layer of paper towels and pat thoroughly with additional towels until dry.</li>
        <li>Pour 3 inches of oil into a large, deep pot. Heat the oil to 300 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Place about 1/3 of the potatoes in the pot, and cook until tender. This takes about 4-5 minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat of the oil to 400 degrees F. Place 1/3 of the potatoes back in the pot and cook for an additional 1-3 minutes or until golden brown. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes. Place the cooked potatoes on a sheet pan lined with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste over the fries. Add parsley if desired, then serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
