HTML - First TOP Project

I started out with some basic HTML, CSS and JS knowlegde due to finishing
a basic coding course through SheCodes. However, this did not include Git
nor Github. That's where The Odin Project(TOP) comes in. So far TOP has
taught me the value of Git and Github and my knowlegde of HTML has already
expanded. I appreciate all the informational sources they provide and I
read through them with curiosity and pleasure; even the additional sources
are of great value.

While I'm still somewhat anxious to work with Git, I sure hope my skills
will have improved at the end of this first project, in comparison to the
start of this course.
